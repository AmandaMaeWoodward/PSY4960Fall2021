Well gawrsh, Mickey this is a fine pickle. Here's hoping this is done right.
One thing I learned was the process of creating a branch in order to make a pull request.
Now while technically I understand what the process is, it's not terribly clear to me yet how to actually do these things in practice. Creating an issue, committing a file, creating a branch, issuing a pull request all makes sense on paper but I'll need to practice to actually figure out how to navigate GitHub comfortably. Just a learning curve.
